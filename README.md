# HEART'N'EYES

## Vision
HEART'N'EYES aims to revolutionize first-person video capture and streaming through smart contact lens technology, allowing users to seamlessly record and share their visual perspective.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the conceptual framework and initial software architecture for the HEART'N'EYES system. The project is designed to interface with specialized contact lens hardware to capture, process, transmit, and store video feeds in real-time.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Contact Lens Hardware Interface**
   - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication protocol
   - Power management system
   - Image sensor data acquisition

2. **Mobile Companion App**
   - Real-time video processing
   - Stream management
   - User interface and controls
   
3. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Video storage and compression
   - Stream distribution
   - Authentication and user management

4. **Content Delivery Network**
   - Integration with popular streaming platforms (YouTube, Twitch, etc.)
   - Custom streaming solution

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Mobile app development for simulated lens input
- Cloud backend setup for initial testing
- Streaming API integration

### Phase 2: Hardware Interface
- Development of communication protocols with contact lens prototypes
- Power optimization
- Image quality enhancement algorithms

### Phase 3: Beta Testing
- Limited user testing with early hardware
- Platform stability improvements
- Security and privacy enhancements

### Phase 4: Public Release
- Full feature release
- Developer API for third-party integrations
- Marketplace for custom filters and effects

## Getting Started

## Privacy and Ethical Considerations
The HEART'N'EYES project acknowledges the significant privacy implications of continuous video capture through wearable technology. We are committed to:

- User control over recording status (clear visual indicators)
- Encrypted transmission and storage
- Consent-based recording in public and private spaces
- Compliance with regional privacy regulations
