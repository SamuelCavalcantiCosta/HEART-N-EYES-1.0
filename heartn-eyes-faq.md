# HEART'N'EYES: Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is HEART'N'EYES?
HEART'N'EYES is an open-source project focused on developing a smart contact lens system capable of recording, streaming, and storing video from the wearer's perspective. It aims to make first-person video capture seamless and unobtrusive.

### Is this available to purchase?
No, HEART'N'EYES is currently a conceptual project. The repository contains software frameworks and architectural designs, but not a commercially available product. The goal is to develop the foundational technology that could make such devices possible in the future.

### How does it work?
Conceptually, the system consists of a smart contact lens with an embedded image sensor, processor, and wireless communication components. This lens connects to a mobile companion app, which processes the video data and interfaces with cloud services for streaming and storage.

### What stage of development is the project in?
The project is in the conceptual design phase. We've created software architectures, data flow models, and interface specifications, but physical prototypes are not yet available.

## Technical Questions

### What resolution can the contact lens camera achieve?
The current design targets 1080p (1920x1080) resolution at 30 frames per second, though this is subject to change as we balance power consumption, data transmission requirements, and other practical constraints.

### How long can the battery last?
The conceptual design aims for approximately 2 hours of continuous recording time or up to 12 hours in standby mode. Actual battery life will depend on hardware implementation and usage patterns.

### How does the data get transmitted?
The design uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication between the contact lens and the mobile companion app. The app then processes this data and can upload it to cloud services via Wi-Fi or cellular connections.

### How much storage does the lens have?
The conceptual design includes 32GB of flash storage integrated into the lens itself, allowing for local recording when not connected to a smartphone.

### Can it work without a smartphone?
The lens is designed to function in standalone mode for basic recording, but a smartphone is required for streaming, cloud uploads, and advanced features.

### Which platforms can I stream to?
The software architecture supports integration with major streaming platforms like YouTube and Twitch, as well as custom RTMP endpoints.

## Privacy and Safety

### Is it obvious when someone is recording?
Ethical considerations are a core part of the project. The design includes visible indicators when recording is active, and we're exploring both technical and policy solutions to ensure transparency.

### What about privacy concerns?
We take privacy very seriously. The project includes:
- User control over recording status
- Encrypted data transmission and storage
- Tools for consent management
- Compliance with regional privacy regulations

### Is it safe to wear a smart contact lens?
Safety would be paramount in any physical implementation. The conceptual design uses biocompatible materials and stays within safe power and temperature limits for ocular devices. Any actual product would require extensive testing and regulatory approval.

### Can the lens be hacked?
The architecture includes multiple security measures, including encrypted communications, secure boot processes, and authentication requirements for all commands.

## Development and Contribution

### How can I contribute to the project?
We welcome contributions from developers, hardware engineers, UI/UX designers, and privacy experts. Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get involved.

### What skills are needed to contribute?
Relevant skills include:
- Mobile development (iOS/Android, React Native)
- Backend development (Node.js, AWS)
- Hardware interface design
- Video processing and streaming protocols
- UI/UX design
- Privacy and security expertise

### Do I need special equipment to test my contributions?
Most software components can be developed and tested using standard development tools and simulators. Hardware-specific components would initially be tested using mock interfaces.

### Is there a roadmap for the project?
Yes, our current roadmap includes:
1. Refining the software architecture and interfaces
2. Developing simulation environments for testing
3. Creating reference implementations of key components
4. Exploring hardware prototyping partnerships
5. Building a community of contributors

## Future Plans

### When might this technology be available?
The timeline for actual smart contact lens products with video capabilities depends on advances in multiple fields, including miniaturized electronics, battery technology, and biocompatible materials. Our goal is to build the software foundation so that when hardware becomes feasible, the ecosystem will be ready.

### What other features might be added?
Future enhancements could include:
- Augmented reality overlays
- Computer vision for object recognition
- Spatial audio recording
- Eye-tracking for control
- Health monitoring capabilities

### Will this be an open-source product?
Yes, our intention is to keep the core technology open source, allowing for innovation and adaptation across various use cases while ensuring transparency in privacy and security aspects.
