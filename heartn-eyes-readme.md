## 👁️ Vision Through Your Eyes

HEART'N'EYES is an open-source project aimed at creating a revolutionary wearable technology system: smart contact lenses capable of recording, streaming, and storing video content directly from the wearer's perspective.

> *"See the world through someone else's eyes - literally."*

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the conceptual framework and initial software architecture for the HEART'N'EYES system, designed to interface with specialized contact lens hardware to capture, process, transmit, and store video feeds in real-time.

### Key Features

- **First-Person Perspective**: Capture video exactly as you see it
- **Wireless Streaming**: Share your vision in real-time with the world
- **Discreet Form Factor**: Nearly invisible recording device
- **Long Battery Life**: Advanced power management for extended use
- **Cloud Integration**: Automatic backup and synchronization
- **Platform Compatibility**: Stream to YouTube, Twitch, and other services
- **Intuitive Controls**: Easy-to-use mobile companion app

## 🧩 System Architecture

The HEART'N'EYES system consists of four main components:

1. **Smart Contact Lens Hardware**
   - Custom image sensor
   - Embedded processor
   - Bluetooth Low Energy communication
   - Battery and power management

2. **Mobile Companion App**
   - Real-time video processing
   - Stream management
   - User interface and controls

3. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Video storage and compression
   - Stream distribution
   - Authentication and user management

4. **Content Delivery Network**
   - Integration with popular streaming platforms
   - Custom streaming solution
